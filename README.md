### Instructions

You will be given a starter repository. First, go through every file in the src directory and go through the comments. Some files will have comments specifying you IGNORE them, so pay attention to that! Your goal is to fill out the `ClubGrid.tsx` and `PersonCard.tsx` components. Your learning goals are as follows:
1. Get used to React and JSX syntax
2. Learn how to use ChakraUI to build modular components (and how to read relevant documentation)
3. Learn how to call an API using Axios

This assignment should take a maximum of 2 hours to complete. If you are struggling, please contact kjeelani@berkeley.edu for advice.

### Prerequisites

You'll need Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from https://nodejs.org/.

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/kjeelani/nextjs-exercise.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory using `cd nextjs-exercise`
3. Install the dependencies using `npm install`

### Running the Application

1. To start the development server, run `npm run dev`
2. Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](url) to see the application in action.

### Other Important Git Commands

1. Before you work on ANYTHING, ensure you have the latest changes from the master via the following steps
   1. Ensure you are on the right branch via `git branch`. You should NEVER be on the master branch. If so, follow step 2a below.
   2.  Use `git pull origin master`. IF THERE ARE MERGE CONFLICTS, CONTACT YOUR PM IMMEDIATELY!
2. When you've made changes, it's important that you follow the proper steps in committing TO THE RIGHT BRANCH!
   1. First, ensure you are in your development branch by `git branch`. If not, create your own via `git checkout -b <branch_name>`.
   2. Then follow `git add .` -> `git commit -m <message>` -> `git push origin <branch_name>`
